# Semester-project-KIV-WEB
This project was done as a part of subject KIV/WEB at University of West Bohemia, Faculty of Applied Sciences. Its purpose is to let authors contribute by adding articles that are subsequently reviewed by either admins or reviewers. Each user may have his role changed by the SuperAdmin, who can see all the users and has the authority to change roles for a role change.
All the articles are required to have at least one image with the option to add attachments. Unlogged users are only allowed to read the articles, but cannot contribute and review.
